# car-rental-system-with-inheritance
The Car Rental System is a C++ mini-project that lets users rent cars for a chosen number of days. It applies OOP concepts like inheritance for car types, file handling to save bookings, and user interaction to display rental details. The program calculates charges, adds service cost, and maintains rental history.
